This is a sample text file.
It contains multiple lines.
Some lines have numbers like 123 and 456.
Other lines have special characters like @#$%.
There are also lines with email addresses like user@example.com.
And some lines have phone numbers like 555-123-4567.
This file will be used for practicing grep, sed, and awk.
Let's include some more data:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.

We'll also add some structured data:

Name: Michael Brown, Age: 42, City: Chicago
Name: Emma Wilson, Age: 31, City: Houston

And some repeated words:

One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.
